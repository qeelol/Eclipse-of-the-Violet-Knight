# Eclipse of the Violet Knight 

Thank you for checking this repository out!
I made a short Metroidvania game for Nanyang Polytechnic's Year 1 Semester 1 Web Development module, which is my first ever programming project after 3 months of learning basic web development.

Now that I'm more familiar with GitHub (since my second semester), I've decided to share this game to GitHub.
There'll be some changes from the original code to make it more playable, though not all bugs will be addressed.
Please refer to "Miscellaneous" for more information.

# Controls (Unchangeable)
A: Move Left
D: Move Right
Space: Jump
Left Alt: Dash
Left Click / Mouse: Side Attack (direction depends where character is facing)
W + Left Click / Mouse: Up Attack
S + Left Click / Mouse: Down Attack
Right Click / Mouse: Heal

# Miscellaneous
There are trash mobs (regular enemies), but they only charge at the player. It's more fun to skip directly to the boss, which is currently the default setting.
CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS: The enemies can be activated by clicking the red skull button at the top-right, and deactivated when clicked again.

Due to issues with syncing audio to the y-axis of the boss, the game canvas is restricted to 1250x669 px.

Some controls, particularly the dash, are quite buggy.
